# Emerging Threats RBN rules.
#
# Rules to detect known Russian Business Network (RBN) hosts. These lists are updated daily or better from many sources
#
# We do not necessarily declare that these hosts are all bad, or that RBN is inherently an evil organization. Use this
#  information as you see fit.
